/**
 * Local estimates of orientations of features in images.
 * Methods of this class can compute for each image sample numerous
 * parameters related to orientation. All orientation information 
 * is derived from eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the structure tensor
 * (also called the "gradient-squared tensor"). This tensor is equivalent 
 * to a matrix of 2nd partial derivatives of an autocorrelation evaluated 
 * at zero lag. In other words, orientation is here determined by the 
 * (2-D) ellipse or (3-D) ellipsoid that best fits the peak of the 
 * autocorrelation of image samples in a local window.
 * <p>
 * The coordinate system for a 2-D image has two orthogonal axes 1 and 2, 
 * which correspond to the 1st and 2nd indices of the array containing 
 * image samples. For 2-D images, the eigenvectors are the unit vectors 
 * u = (u1,u2) and v = (v1,v2). The 1st eigenvector u is perpendicular 
 * to the best fitting line, and the 1st component u1 of u is always 
 * non-negative. The 2nd eigenvector v is perpendicular to u such that 
 * the cross product u1*v2-u2*v1 = 1; that is, v1 = -u2 and v2 = u1. 
 * The angle theta = asin(u2) is the angle measured counter-clockwise 
 * between the 1st eigenvector u and axis 1; -pi/2 &lt;= theta &lt;= pi/2.
 * <p>
 * The coordinate system for a 3-D image has three orthogonal axes 1, 2 
 * and 3, which correspond to the 1st, 2nd and 3rd indices of the array 
 * containing image samples. For 3-D images, the eigenvectors are unit 
 * vectors u = (u1,u2,u3), v = (v1,v2,v3), and w = (w1,w2,w3). The 1st 
 * eigenvector u is orthogonal to the best fitting plane, and the 1st 
 * component u1 of u is always non-negative. The 2nd eigenvector v is 
 * orthogonal to the best fitting line within the best fitting plane.
 * The 3rd eigenvector w is orthogonal to both u and v and is aligned
 * with the direction in which the images changes least. The dip angle 
 * theta = acos(u1) is the angle between the 1st eigenvector u and axis 1; 
 * 0 &lt;= theta &lt;= pi/2. The azimuthal angle phi = atan2(u3,u2)
 * is well-defined for only non-zero theta; -pi &lt;= phi &lt;= pi.
 * <p>
 * The local linearity or planarity of features is determined by the
 * eigenvalues. For 2-D images with eigenvalues eu and ev (corresponding 
 * to the eigenvectors u and v), linearity is (eu-ev)/eu. For 3-D
 * images with eigenvalues eu, ev, and ew, planarity is (eu-ev)/eu
 * and linearity is (ev-ew)/eu. Both linearity and planarity are
 * in the range [0,1].
